## Update Assistant Functionality - FULLY WORKING ✅ (2025-09-18)

**Issue Resolved**: The "Update Assistant" button was crashing with validation errors and not properly updating existing assistants.

**Root Cause**: Frontend form validation failure due to improper form data population in `AssistantEditView.vue`. The `useForm` composable requires `setFieldValue()` method instead of direct assignment to reactive form fields.

**Fix Applied**:
1. **Backend was already correct**: Using `client.beta.assistants.update(assistant_id, **update_data)` - the proper OpenAI Assistants API modify endpoint that preserves the same `assistant_id`
2. **Frontend form fix**: Replaced direct assignments `form.value.name = data.name` with proper `setFieldValue('name', data.name)` calls
3. **Validation flow**: Form now properly populates with assistant data, passes validation, and submits successfully

**Technical Details**:
- File: `frontend/src/views/AssistantEditView.vue`
- Fix: Added `setFieldValue` to useForm destructuring and used it for form population
- Backend: `backend/api/assistants.py` line 270 - correct OpenAI modify endpoint usage
- Result: Complete end-to-end Update Assistant workflow functional

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ Form loads with assistant data properly populated
- ✅ Validation passes (no more "name required" errors)
- ✅ Backend calls OpenAI's modify assistant endpoint (preserving assistant_id)
- ✅ Assistant gets updated with new field values
- ✅ User redirected back to assistants list

## Delete Functionality Fixed and Optimized (2025-09)

**Backend Fixes**:
1. Fixed the 500 error with tool_resources update when deleting files
2. Proper empty file handling - explicitly passes empty array when no files remain
3. Better error handling for files that don't exist in OpenAI

**Frontend Optimizations**:
1. Optimistic UI updates - files immediately removed from UI
2. Proper event flow - delete button → local function → optimistic update → emit to parent
3. Error feedback logging

**Complete Flow**:
1. User clicks delete → Confirmation dialog
2. UI immediately removes the file (optimistic update)
3. Backend removes file from assistant's tool_resources in OpenAI
4. File deleted from OpenAI storage
5. Database metadata cleaned up

## Large Response Handling (2025-09)

**Issue**: "Unable to connect to the server" error with large formatted responses (4K+ characters with legal citations)

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced nginx buffer configuration
- Multi-part response handling
- Proper message aggregation from OpenAI
- Extended timeouts for complex assistant processing

**Result**: Legal assistant now handles complex Bluebook citation responses smoothly

## Authentication Flow - FULLY WORKING ✅

**Current State**:
- JWT tokens stored in localStorage as 'auth_token'
- Axios interceptors configured in setupInterceptors.ts
- Auth state managed by Pinia store with persistence
- Token validation prevents storing invalid tokens
- API response parsing handles backend's nested format

**Known Issues Resolved**:
- ✅ CORS: Fixed by updating FRONTEND_URL to new deployment URL
- ✅ Auth redirect: Fixed API response parsing and token validation
- ✅ Token attachment: Fixed by proper axios interceptor setup
- ✅ API paths: Frontend correctly uses /api prefix

## Forgot Password Feature (2025-09-22)

**Implemented**:
- Email sending via Gmail SMTP with App Password
- Secure JWT reset tokens with 1-hour expiry
- HTML email templates
- Password update functionality

**Configuration**:
- Gmail SMTP with App Password authentication
- Email templates with reset button/link
- Secure token generation and validation

## Assistant-Specific Threads (Option 2 Implementation)

**Architecture**:
1. Database: Added thread_id column to user_assistants table
2. Backend: Updated endpoints to use assistant-specific threads
3. Thread Management: Each user-assistant pair gets persistent OpenAI thread
4. New Thread API: Users can reset threads for specific assistants

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Multiple concurrent conversations with different assistants
- ✅ Thread persistence - conversations resume where left off
- ✅ Thread reset capability per assistant
- ✅ Proper MMACTEMP pattern: create → messages.create → runs.create flow
- ✅ Immediate chat interface activation

---

## MMACTEMP Pattern Implementation

**File Purpose Assignment**:
- Image files (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp, .gif) → purpose: 'vision' ✅
- Document files → purpose: 'assistants' ✅
- Frontend preference honored if explicitly sent

**Chat Processing**:
- Vision files → Added to message content for immediate viewing
- Assistant files → Added to tool_resources for code_interpreter
- Proper separation between file types

**Result**: Clean separation of vision and assistant files like cloud-deployed MMACTEMP app

## Debugging Practices

### Common Authentication Issues (Now Resolved)
1. **Token not attached**: Check `utils/setupInterceptors.ts` axios configuration
2. **CORS errors**: Verify `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable matches deployment URL
3. **Invalid tokens**: Backend validates JWT and extracts user context properly
4. **Response parsing**: API responses use nested format that must be parsed correctly
